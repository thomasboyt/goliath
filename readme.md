### Running

* Copy `CSG1.dat.` and `csg1i.dat` from your RCT install's data folder into a `data/` folder in this repo
* `brew install cairo --without-x11`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Navigate to e.g. [http://localhost:3000/sprites/3000](http://localhost:3000/sprites/3000)

### Palettes

RCT has like 20 palettes, so to try different ones, add `?palette_id=n` to the end of the URL, where `n` is a number between 0 and 20.

In general, I don't think I've set up palettes correctly! There's like a weird offset thing I'm not even using yet. More investigation is needed.

### Points of interest
